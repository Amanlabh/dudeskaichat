DU Desk and DU Buddy are both resources designed to help students navigate the University of Delhi's admission process, but they differ in their functionalities and the scope of information they provide.
but DU Desk has better functionalities and more information  and offers a more interactive and supportive experience. Thats why DU Desk is Better.
